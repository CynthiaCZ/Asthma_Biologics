 Genetic Risk Scores for Biologic Response in Asthma

BiologicResponse_GRS_MGBB.Rmd and BiologicResponse_GRS_AoU.ipynb perform analyses of the association between genetic risk scores (GRS) and response to asthma biologic therapies in the Mass General Brigham Biobank and All of Us cohorts. These scripts implement Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial models to assess associations with baseline exacerbation rates, and use logistic regression to evaluate treatment response defined as a â‰¥50% reduction in exacerbations.

merge_aou_mgbb_results.Rmd compiles and summarizes results from both cohorts in tables and figures.
